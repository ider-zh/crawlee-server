# Web Scraping API Service

A Node.js service for crawling and scraping web pages using Playwright.
It is configured to send the results to a postgres database.  Configure in .env file

Docker compose file includes commented out configuration options to scale to multiple containers.  Add more ports to the range if you plan to go above 4 instances.  I've tested it on an 8 core 16gb Root VPS with a AMD EPYC™ 9634, max performance on that setup is around 5-6 containers.

You can adjust the memory used by the scraper and max concurrency in the .env file.  There is less chance of rate limiting if you keep concurrency in the 3-5 range, but I've done over 100, when limits aren't set, on some websites when not limited.  

Uses ramdisk to help with IO performance. 

Intened to be used with this n8n build:
